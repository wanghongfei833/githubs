# ONNet

**ONNet** is an open-source Python/C++ package for the optical neural networks, which provides many tools for researchers studying optical neural
networks. Some new models are as follows:

- #### Express Wavenet

  ![](./ONNet_wavelet.png)

  Express Wavenet uses random shift wavelet pattern to modulate the phase of optical waves, which only need one percent of the parameters and the
  accuracy is still high. In the MNIST dataset, it only needs 1229 parameters to get accuracy of 92%, while DDNet needs 125440 parameters. .[2]

- #### Diffractive deep neural network with multiple frequency-channels

  Each layer have multiple frequency-channels (optical distributions at different frequency). These channels are merged at the output plane with
  weighting coefficient. [1]

- #### Diffractive network with multiple binary output plane

Optical neural network(ONN) is a novel machine learning framework on the physical principles of optics, which is still in its infancy and shows great
potential. ONN tries to find optimal modulation parameters to change the phase, amplitude or other physical variable of optical wave propagation. So
in the final output plane, the optical distribution has special pattern which is the indicator of object’s class or value. ONN opens new doors for the
machine learning.
